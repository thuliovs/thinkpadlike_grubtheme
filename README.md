# thinkpad like grub theme
Here is a theme to match thinkpad original colors. Only black, white and the iconic thinkpad red.

## instalation
To use this theme i recommend installing the *GRUB Customizer* app, a visual GRUB theme customizer.

Simply clone the repository in a folder of your preference. Then in *Grub Customizer* select the "Appearance settings" tab and in there click on the "+" to add the folder *theme.tar.gz* of the cloned repository.

You also can reference it in the ```/etc/default/grub``` on the line ```GRUB_THEME="/boot/grub/themes/thinkpad3/theme.txt"``` whiteout installing any third-party program either using the compressed folder.

### about theme size
How i made this for my T480 1920x1080 screen *this theme is exclusively for FullHD screens*.

* 1.5x is for average 1100 lines screen (Full HD)
